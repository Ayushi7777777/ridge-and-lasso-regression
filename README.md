# Ridge and Lasso Regression with Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to use **Ridge** and **Lasso** regression in Python using `sklearn`. It includes:
- Data preprocessing using `StandardScaler`
- Train-test split
- Model fitting using Ridge and Lasso
- Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`
- Evaluation with `mean squared error` and `best_score_`

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib

## ðŸ’¡ Goal
To learn and compare Ridge and Lasso regularization techniques and see how tuning hyperparameters can improve model accuracy.
